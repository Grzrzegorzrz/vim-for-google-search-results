# Vim for Google Search Results

Vim motions for Google search results.

Inspired by DuckDuckGo's vim option for search results as well as [Vim Navigation for Google](https://github.com/VencislavManoilov/vim-navigation-google/tree/chrome), the latter of which had dissatisfactory keybindings and styling, resulting in this addon.

## Keybindings

- `j` – Select result below
- `k` – Select result above
- `gg` – Select first result
- `G` – Select last result
- `l / Enter` – Load site
- `L / Shift + Enter` – Open the selected site in a **new tab**
